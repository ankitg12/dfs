Assignment #07

a. Complete the TODOs in the files real_sfs_minimal.c & real_sfs_ops.c in here.
b. Compile the driver sfs_first.ko by typing "make".
c. Load the driver sfs_bb.ko using "sudo insmod sfs_bb.ko". You may have to do the following, if previous assignment's driver still running:
	> sudo umount /mnt
	> sudo rmmod sfs_bb
d. Post the snapshots of the following:
	> grep sfs /proc/filesystems
	> sudo mount -t sfs /dev/rb3 /mnt # Observe the error
	> sudo mount -t sfs /dev/rb1 /mnt # No error (assuming mkfs.sfs has already been done)
	> mount | grep sfs
	> df
	> stat /mnt
	> cd /mnt # Observe the error
	> ls /mnt # Observe the error
